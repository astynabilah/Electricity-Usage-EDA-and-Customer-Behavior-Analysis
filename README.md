# Electricity Usage Analysis and Recommendations

## Overview
This project analyzes electricity usage patterns based on hourly, daily, and monthly data. The findings are used to provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing electricity production.  

## Findings & Insights
- Peak electricity usage occurs between 19:00 - 20:00, requiring higher power generation.
- Lowest electricity usage is observed at 04:00 - 05:00. 
- Consumption increases in the morning (06:00 - 08:00), remains moderate during midday (08:00 - 15:00), and rises again in the evening. 
- Electricity demand is highest in December - January, lowest in October, with a slight increase in June. 
- Weekly trends show higher usage on weekends compared to weekdays.

## Recommendations for Electricity Production
Based on the assumption that all households in the neighborhood follow the same electricity usage pattern, the following recommendations can be made:

### Monthly Production Adjustments:
- Increase electricity production from December to January to approximately 0.84 kWh/household.
- Gradually reduce production in the following months, with a decrease of around 0.2 kWh per household per month, reaching a minimum of 0.32 kWh/household.
- Increase production slightly in June by 0.1 kWh/household and maintain a stable level until September.
- Reduce electricity production in October to around 0.3 kWh/household, but prepare for an increase in November to 0.54 kWh/household.

### Hourly Usage Adjustments:
- Allocate 0.95 kWh/household during peak hours (19:00 - 20:00).
- Gradually decrease supply by 0.1 kWh per household per hour until reaching 0.25 kWh/household at 05:00.
- Prepare for an increase at 06:00, where consumption rises to 0.39 kWh/household.
- Consumption peaks at 07:00 (0.75 kWh/household) before slightly declining as morning activities settle.
- From 08:00 to 15:00, electricity consumption remains moderate, fluctuating between 0.45 - 0.55 kWh/household, reflecting a mix of residential and minimal appliance use.
- In the afternoon, energy demand starts rising at 16:00, reaching 0.8 kWh/household by 18:00, before peaking again at 19:00 - 20:00.

### Weekly Consumption Trends:
- Increase electricity production on Saturdays and Sundays to approximately 0.56 kWh/household.
- Reduce production on Monday to 0.48 kWh/household.
- Maintain a steady level of around 0.5 kWh/household for Tuesday and Wednesday.
- Gradually increase production by 0.02 kWh/household per day for the remainder of the week.
